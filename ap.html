<h1>Kohinoor Of INDIA</h1>
<h2>Andhra Pradesh</h2>
<body>
	<p>Andhra Pradesh is called the "Kohinoor of India" because the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond is believed to have originated from the Kollur Mine in the Guntur District of present-day Andhra Pradesh during the Kakatiya Dynasty. The region's historical connection to the renowned diamond, a symbol of power and wealth, led to its metaphorical title as the "Kohinoor of India".</p>
	<h3>Arts and Culture</h3>
	<p>Andhra Pradesh boasts a rich cultural legacy of classical dance (Kuchipudi), vibrant arts and crafts like Kalamkari and Bidriware, distinct spicy cuisine, and magnificent architecture, shaped by centuries of diverse dynastic rule. This heritage is expressed through unique folk traditions, elaborate festivals such as Ugadi and Sankranti, spiritual sites like Tirupati, and a significant history of religion and philosophy.  </p>
